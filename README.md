# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets-With-Polarity-Based-Models
Classification of Tweets (Positive, Neutral and Negative) based on Polarity derived either from a Lexicon or from Sentiwordnet Synonyms.

Detailed description of the project can be found in the Power Point presentation attached.

In the File Experiments on Sentiment Analysis for tweets classification.ipynb I perform some experiments to get confident with NLP libraries and to have a baseline of a SVM classifier based on a tf-idf matrix, after reducing the dimension with LDA.
